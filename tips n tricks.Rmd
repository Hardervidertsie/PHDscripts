```{r}

library(data.table)

## Fix up your example data.frame so that the columns aren't all factors
## (not necessary, but shows that data.table can now use numeric columns as keys)
cols <- c(1:5, 7:10)
test[cols] <- lapply(cols, FUN=function(X) as.numeric(as.character(test[[X]])))
test[11] <- as.logical(test[[11]])

## Create two data.tables with which to demonstrate a data.table merge
dt <- data.table(test, key=names(test))
dt2 <- copy(dt)
## Add to each one a unique non-keyed column
dt$X <- seq_len(nrow(dt))
dt2$Y <- rev(seq_len(nrow(dt)))

## Merge them based on the keyed columns (in both cases, all but the last) to ...
## (1) create a new data.table
dt3 <- dt[dt2]
## (2) or (poss. minimizing memory usage), just add column Y from dt2 to dt
dt[dt2,Y:=Y]
  

One very useful function I often use is dput(), which allows you to dump an object in the form of R code.

str() tells you the structure of any object.

with(df, A + B) ## I know this will use A in df!
with() sets up an environment within which the R expression is evaluated. within() does the same thing but allows you to modify the data object used to create the environment.

df$1
Error: unexpected numeric constant in "df$1"
> df$`1`
In this case, df[,"1"] would also work. But back ticks work inside formulas!
  
  The traceback() function is a must when you have an error somewhere and do not understand it readily. It will print a trace of the stack, very helpful as R is not very verbose by default.

Then setting options(error=recover) will allow you to "enter" into the function raising the error and try and understand what happens exactly, as if you had full control over it and could put a browser() in it.

These three functions can really help debugging your code.

system()

pipe()

data.frame(VAR = names(df), COL = seq_along(df))

```
