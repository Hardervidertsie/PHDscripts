This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **MD** toolbar button for help on Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

rm(list=ls())
my.path.M<-"/home/winks/R_HOME/R_WORK/mArray BAC reporter studie/results/DEGs/PHH bioc BA sign overlap genes/overlap/overlap with FC filter/timeM"
my.path.H<-"/home/winks/R_HOME/R_WORK/mArray BAC reporter studie/results/DEGs/PHH bioc BA sign overlap genes/overlap/overlap with FC filter/timeH"
my.files.M <- dir(my.path.M)
my.files.H <- dir(my.path.H)

# get overlapping genes
output.l= list()
output.l.timeM = list()
for ( i in 1: length(my.files.M)){

my.data.M <- read.table(paste(my.path.M , my.files.M[i],  sep = "/"), sep =',')
my.data.H <- read.table(paste(my.path.H , my.files.H[i],  sep = "/"), sep =',')
#head(my.data)
output.l[[i]] <- my.data.M
output.l.timeM[[i]] <- my.data.H
}

output <- c(output.l, output.l.timeM)

output.df <- do.call('rbind', output)

dim(output.df)
 output.df<- unique(output.df)

#setwd("/home/winks/R_HOME/R_WORK/mArray BAC reporter studie/results/DEGs/PHH bioc BA sign overlap genes/overlap/timeM")

write.table(output.df, file = "backgroundTRANSFAC_PHH_FClog2_1.2_p_0.05andOVERLAPmiddleANDhigh.csv", sep ='\t', row.names = F, col.names = F)



```
